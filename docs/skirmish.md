# Skirmish

## Introduction

## Setup and Materials
### Playing Space and Terrain
### Dice
You should have at least 1 of each of the following dice:
* d20
* d10
* d6
* d4

A standard RPG dice set and some additonal d6s is recommended. Having at least 2d10 is recommended and handful of d6 as these are used as bonus dice.
### Models
Any standard game models are suitable, the most common skirmish model size is going to be 28mm. Mix and match, make your own. All players should generally have similar sized miniatures (unless of course there is a narrative reason for the size difference).
### Tokens
### Misc

## Models
Models are broken into 2 broad (very broad) categories, "Small Models" and "Big Models" that have different stats and rules. "Small Models" going to humanoid sized (even if they are not human) and include creatures such as animals (like dogs and cats). "Big Models" are anything like vehicles, large animals/creatures/monsters (like an elephant...or a dinosaur). Depending on how dynamic you want your play area, terrain features could also be vehicles.

### Small Models
There are no hit points. Period. Forget about them. When a small model is "wounded" they are turned on their side and in the recovery phase it will determined if they are removed from play.

### Big Models
Big models also do not have hit points, however they have armor values that help prevent them from being destroyed. Armor values are applied in the following way:
* Front
* Side
* Rear

If a big model has an armor value of 0 to 1, the big model may only be damaged at melee range. An armor value of 2+ can only be damaged by attacks with an Armor Penetration value.

Big models can explode in the recovery phase.
### Movement
* Small Models can move 6 inches.
* Big Models can move 12 inches.

## Playing the Game
Each game is divided up into predetermined number of rounds with each player taking turns in each round. A round ends when a player rolls a 1 on for their Action Points roll at which point there is a recovery phase where downed models will either return to play or be removed from the game as a casualty.

### Round
At the start of each round the players will roll for the initiative order that will last for the round. All players roll a d20 and determine playing order starting with highest roll in descending order.

### Player Turns and Sequence
Each player alternates taking turns starting with rolling for action points. A player's turn ends when they are spent all of their action points, then the next player takes their turn. Alternate between players until a player rolls a 1 for Action Points, which ends the round and begins recovery.

The player turn has the following phases in order:
1. Roll for Action Points aka "Command Phase"
2. Purchase Bonus Dice
3. Activate models with Action Points aka "Action Phase"
4. Purchase Bonus Dice

Action points may be traded for bonus dice BEFORE models are activated and/or AFTER models are finished being activated. You can not purchase bonus dice during the "action phase".

#### Roll for Action Points aka "Command Phase"
Roll 1d20 to generate action points to be spent on your turn. Actions points can be used to move models around, initiate combat, perform narratice actions, or be exchanged for bonus dice.

Action points do not carry from turn-to-turn or round-to-round.

#### Activate models with Action Points aka "Action Phase"
Models can perform the following actions:
* Movement
* Combat
* Narratively interact with the environment

A model can move up three times per activation, the cost of movement is:
* 1st Movement is 1 AP
* 2nd Movement is 3 AP
* 3rd Movement is 5 AP

A model cannot move, perform combat, and move again.

#### Spend Action Points on Bonus Dice
**Bonus dice** are special d6's that are purchased with Action Points at a cost of 1 AP per Bonus Dice. Bonus dice can be added to other rolls or to movement. Bonus dice do carry from turn-to-turn but not round-to-round. Each player can have no more than 6 Bonus Dice at time. 

Action points can be spent on purchasing bonus dice to be used in the current game round, including in the turn in which they were purchased.

| Bonus Dice | Action Point Cost |
| ---------- | ----------------- |
|     1      | 1 Action Point    |
|     2      | 2 Action Points   |
|	  3      | 4 Action Points   |
|     4      | 7 Action Points   |
|     5      | 12 Action Points  |
|     6      | 20 Action Points  |

### Combat
#### Ranged
Ranged combat is very simple, the attacker uses a ranged item to attempt to knock the defender into the "downed state" using a random dice roll. Both players roll their dice with the higher player winning.
1. Select target within range of weapon profile.
2. Attacker will roll to attack with a d10, plus any bonus dice and/or modifiers.
3. Defender will roll to defend with a d10, plus any bonus dice and/or modifiers.
4. If attacker beats defender, the defending model is turned on it's side and is considered down. The model is not necessarily removed from the game. During the recovery phase the model can attempt to return to the game.
#### Melee
Melee combat is far more dangerous for both attacker and defender, with each model attempting to best the other model. The loser of a melee combat is put into a "downed state" and the winner may move up to 3 inches.
1. Select target within range of weapon profile.
2. Attacker will roll to attack with a d10, plus any bonus dice and/or modifiers.
3. Defender will roll to defend with a d10, plus any bonus dice and/or modifiers.
4. Losing model is turned on it's side and is in a "downed state" until the recovery phase.
#### Cover
Models behind terrain features can reasonably claim a benefit for defense therefore, add +1 to any defense roll.

### Recovery Phase
After a game round has ended, there is a recovery phase before the next round begins. This is an opportunity for each player's team to determine casualities, regroup, or flee.
