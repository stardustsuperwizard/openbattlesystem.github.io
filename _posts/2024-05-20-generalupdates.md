title:  "General Updates"

# Welcome!
Excited to kick off this site! For the moment it is a place for me experiment with website technology and to try my hand at making games that I hope people will play.

Biggest updates are that I added my first game, "Skirmish" to the site and added a listing of vendors to buy models and terrain.

I hope you like what you find here and I will be updating more soon.
